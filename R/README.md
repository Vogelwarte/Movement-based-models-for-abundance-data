# Instructions

The files "Sim_Capture.R", "Sim_Snapshot.R" and "Sim_EcoDiff.R" contain R functions to simulate the proposed models.
The files "EcoDiff_ll.R" and "Gauss_ll.R" contain custom functions to compute the exact log-likelihood of an EcoDiff model and of a Gaussian random vector respectively. The last one can be regularized and continuity-corrected.
