# Movement-based-models-for-abundance-data
Routines and R coded functions for the results in Movement-based models for abundance data (Carrizo Vergara et al., 2024)

The folder "R" contains the R functions and routines necessary to reproduce the obtained results and do further analyses if desired. Instructions for using them are present in such folder.

The folder "pseudo-codes" contains the outlines of the simulation functions here implemented.
